                <h4>Documents</h4>
                The entity named <b><i>Document<sup class="small">*</sup></i></b> is used within the API in the very broad sense of: <i>all attributes other than Contact Point, Location, or Tag</i>.
                <br /><br />

                Documents, along with the robust set of pre-defined document UserTypes provide flexibility and extensibility to The API.  
                The Document field <span class="tokenize">value</span> stores up to 4000 characters, of which the first 900 are indexed.
                <br /><br />
                Documents are used to store custom fields, files, notes, ratings, and other data types which are defined by the primitive per the document's usertype.
                Documents can be related to a person, organization, touch, a person on a particular touch, and/or belong to a private group.
                Every document has one usertype and that usertype will be of one of the available document primitive types, listed below.

                <h4>Document Primitives</h4>
                All document usertypes must be defined as one of the primitives.  Documents have a name (140 characters max) and a value (4000 characters max.)  What each contains and how it is displayed and handled is determined by the primitive.
                <br />
                <br />
                Primitives make it easy for developers extend the API to capture any information or media required in their solution.
