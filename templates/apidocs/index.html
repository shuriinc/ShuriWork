            <h3>Overview</h3>
            The Shuri API is a powerful and easy-to-use <strong>application programming interface</strong> that provides highly secure global data services to <strong>relationship management</strong> apps.
            It provides fast, secure and global data storage web scale, and is based on a simple Relationship Management pattern.  In addition, the API's unique <i><strong>multiple database</strong></i>
            capability makes collaborating and sharing data easy.

            <br /><br />
            To view more of the API docs, we ask that you please <a ui-sref="master.apiKey">register</a> - it is fast and free.  Why?  Because on most of the documentation pages, there are working demos of the API resources and those require authentication.

                    There is no charge to develop applications using the API, however all API calls must be authenticated with a key.

            <h4>API Resources</h4>
            The API has been built from the ground up to support the data storage needs of any relationship management application by providing a simpler, more concise, yet still incredibly useful vocabulary - all based entirely on the model.


            <br />
            <br />
            Resources exposed by The API includes 3 "core" entities and several "attribute" entities:
            <ul>
                <li><strong><a ui-sref="master.apidocsPeople">People</a></strong></li>
                <li><strong><a ui-sref="master.apidocsTouches">Touches</a></strong></li>
                <li><strong><a ui-sref="master.apidocsGroups">Groups</a></strong></li>
                <li>
                    Attributes<ul>
                        <li><strong><a ui-sref="master.apidocsTags">Tags</a></strong></li>
                        <li><strong><a ui-sref="master.apidocsContactPoints">ContactPoints</a></strong></li>
                        <li><strong><a ui-sref="master.apidocsLocations">Locations</a></strong></li>
                        <li><strong><a ui-sref="master.apidocsDocuments">Documents</a></strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            One additional entity, <strong><a ui-sref="master.apidocsUserTypes">UserTypes</a></strong>, enables extensibility and customization for developers.
            With just these 8 entities, the API supports a very wide range of relationship management functionality.
            <br /><br />
            <br /><strong>Key API Concepts:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Every instance of any entity must be associated to one database.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Instances are owned by a single person.  Optionally, instances may be also owned by a single team.  Only owners may update the instance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Any database may be "published" to a Team whose members may then subscribe.  Subscribers get "read-only" privileges to everything in the database.
                </li>
                <li>
                    No practical limit to the number of instances of any entity in The API.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Instances are identified by a globally unique id.
                </li>
            </ol>
