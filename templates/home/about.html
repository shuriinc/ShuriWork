            <br />Our reputation is paramount and can only be earned over time by always working to earn our customers' trust.  We conduct all our interactions honestly and openly.  We never misrepresent.  We follow through on promises.

            <strong>Passion.</strong> When people take pride in their work, customers know it.
            <br />We work hard to make sure our customers are satisfied.  If anyone is ever unhappy with our products or services, it becomes our problem and number 1 priority.  Customer satisfaction is the top measure of our success.

            <strong>Provide Value.</strong>
            <br />Our products and services provide tremendous value to our customers, and also return a profit to the company that is shared by all the employee owners.

        <li>
            <strong>Fun.  Laughs. </strong> We have a life.
            <br />While we expect everyone to "bring their ‘A’ game," we also want to have a lot of fun along the way
            and maintain a healthy work-life balance.  Shuri  will be a great place to work.  Our business is our employees.
